# Since the access to our High Five custom pages is granted based on custom
# permissions, we need to define those permissions here. Defining permissions here ensures
# that they are available to enable on the permissions administration pages.
#
# For more info see: https://www.drupal.org/node/2311427

#
# Tasks:
#   1) Create 'access highfive about' permission.
#        - This allows users to access the "About High Fives" page.
#
#   2) Create 'give highfives' permission.
#        - This allows users to specify two names to give each other a high five.
#
# Hint:
#  Copy the 'access highfive tutorial' permission (including title and description),
#  then paste and modify as needed.
